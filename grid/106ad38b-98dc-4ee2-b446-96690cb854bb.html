Some of those goddesses even went on to become idols.<br>However, there were others who simply refused to follow the rules. These goddesses prefer living freely and doing as they please, inadvertently causing all sorts of trouble for humans.<br><br>Goddesses who are naughty are called Aragami.<br><br>The protagonist, Sho Narumi, stumbles upon a goddess who collapses on the street and attempts to help her. Soon enough it is revealed that she's the Aragami who had been causing frequent power outages in one small-town area of Tokyo. Sho decides to protect his beloved hometown by helping the goddess to get rehabilitated!<br><br>&quot;Rehabilitate the goddess!&quot;<br><br>Wait...aren't goddesses supposed to help humans?<br><br>With the setting moving from Akihabara to a quiet small-town area of Tokyo, the story of one naughty goddess's rehabilitation begins now!<h2 class="bb_tag">Story Backbone</h2>The story roughly remains the same, there's just something that's a little different...<br>This is the tale of an unusual goddess set in a slightly different Japan.<br><br>The Goddesses Descend!<br><br>It was a time when people had forgotten their dreams and lost faith.<br>The silhouettes of goddesses revealed themselves to the people who then could only believe in what they saw right in front of them.<br><br>The confusion surrounding the countless goddesses appearing in Japan could be explained due to Amaterasu Omikami wanting to teach the goddesses about the human world.<br>All of this brought about the implementation of the Divine Education Act.<br>Consequently, the goddesses were able to learn, familiarize, and communicate with humans.<br><br>This cross-cultural exchange between goddesses and humans helped to show the world's many colors.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/626510/extras/characters.jpg?t=1573642502" /><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/626510/extras/Character-Intro_akane.png?t=1573642502" /><br>An Aragami brought down to the world by the Divine Education Act.<br>She's a naughty goddess who skips school.<br><br>Although she possesses the power to manipulate electricity, since she's an Aragami, she can only make electricity go haywire.<br>She accidentally causes power outages when angry or irritated.<br><br>Since she easily gets angry, she causes power outages almost every day somewhere in town.<br><br>Though she'd like to be in control of her power, things always spiral out of control when she tries to use them.<br>This doesn't bother her, since she figures it's only natural for an Aragami, such as herself, to cause messes here and there.<br><br>She's stubborn and does what she wants, but it's not because she won't listen to instruction, she just doesn't want to do what she doesn't understand.<br>She gets a kick out of teasing Sho by trying to seduce him.<br>She also occasionally pulls pranks on Sho and seduces him in front of Maika to make her jealous.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/626510/extras/Character-Intro_inori.png?t=1573642502" /><br>An earth goddess dispatched to rehabilitate Akane who keeps causing damage to the town by not following the Divine Education Act.<br><br>This goddess is serious and focused, but innocent; she doesn't seem to know a lot about certain things.<br>Despite being the local earth goddess, she never acts arrogant, and instead talks politely to everyone.<br>She is charming and elegant, but is also fairly clumsy.<br><br>She is easy-going, with a docile personality, but brings heavy rainfall to the town when she gets angry.<br>Although she rarely gets angry, once she does, the damage she inflicts is incomparable to Akane's.<br><br>She broods over the fact that she has no prominent advantages over other goddesses, and hates to get mislabeled as a &quot;dirt goddess.&quot;<br><br>Because of her laid-back personality, she doesn't really care even if Sho sees her naked.<br>She'd even ask if he'd like to touch her chest.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/626510/extras/Character-Intro_maika.png?t=1573642502" /><br>Sho's junior, landlady, and close childhood friend.<br>She's just your average fashionable girl.<br>Her looks are stylish and she loves wearing makeup.<br><br>Contrary to her appearance, she's rather diligent and capable.<br>She has feelings for Sho, but can't find it in her to confess.<br>Although she works as the apartment landlady with her mother while attending school, she often makes comments about not caring if the old building gets demolished.<br>In actuality, she's a good kid and is serious about looking over the apartments.<br>She's tsundere, and wants to continue living there together with Sho.<br><br>Sometimes she gets jealous when Akane or Inori gets too friendly with Sho.<br>Even though she seems to know about the adult world, she blushes intensely only when Sho sees her underwear.
