Yi-Lin, the Jade Sentinel has awoken to defend Centre once more against the hordes of orcs, soldiers, and her old enemies – the Wu Xing Dynasty.Learn more about Yi-Lin in the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://orcsmustdie.com/#!/en/news/designingyilin" target="_blank" rel="noopener"  >Designing Yi-Lin</a> blog.<h2 class="bb_tag">New Faction: The Wu Xing, Masters of the Five Elements</h2>The Wu Xing are masters of the five elements. Deadly and resilient they make dangerous foes!<ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Wu Xing Soldiers: </strong>These soldiers come in four forms: light, medium, heavy, and ranged.  All of the soldiers have magic armor, making physical damage optimal in defeating them.</li><li><strong>Terracotta Giant: </strong>These slow-moving stone giants do not attack players.  Instead, they perform a steady march to the rift, slowing any player that gets too close.</li><li><strong>Red Panda:</strong> Despite being called the Red Panda, these minions are actually blue!  Be careful, these minions cast a powerful speed buff on allied minions.</li><li><strong>Water Dragon: </strong>This hunter minion focuses on players.  Unlike other Hunter minions, this minion has a splash attack, damaging all players within a cone in front of him.</li><li><strong>Elemental Mages:</strong> These mages throw bouncing orbs of elemental energy.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">New Maps: Three Brand New Maps</h2><strong>Water Garden - Survival (Apprentice and Master)</strong><br>The water gardens of the White Tiger Empire appear to be closest to the first attacks by the Wu Xing Dynasty.

Funneling the front gates to one side is imperative.<br><br><strong>Midnight Market - Survival (Warmage and Rift Lord) and Sabotage</strong><br>These marketplaces of the White Tiger Empire are popular night spots.

Unchained's new game mode, Sabotage! This fast-paced mode is a totally new way to play. Players assemble a team to defend their rift, but at the same time another team is playing on the same map in some… spooky… alternate dimension or something. These other players can distract your team with spells, minions, and huge bosses to make you lose rift points. But of course, players can pay 'em back by doing the same! The team with the most rift points at the end of the match wins.
